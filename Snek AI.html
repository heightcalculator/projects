        <p>
            This report investigates methods of modifying Hamiltonian cycles without sacrificing hamiltonicity in order
            to complete an optimized perfect game of Snake where the snake fills the entire 8x8 board (or any square
            board with side lengths in multiples of 2) in the minimal amount of turns without hitting itself or the
            walls until all the squares in the grid are filled. The importance of maintaining a Hamiltonian cycle at all
            times ensures the snake never finds itself without a safe move, always having a path to any point on the
            grid. Although there are multiple ways of creating a perfect game of snake including machine learning
            techniques such as deep Q-learning and reinforcement learning, these are very time and computationally
            intensive to both train and execute. As such, we developed an algorithmic solution which modifies an
            existing Hamiltonian cycle and accomplishes the same task in around 30% fewer turns.

        <h2>2 &emsp; Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Snake is a game in which a "snake" controlled by the player can move either up, down, left, or right on a
            square
            grid. The player's goal is to move the snake towards the "apples,"" which spawn randomly on the grid
            following
            the consumption of an apple. As the snake consumes an apple, it grows in size by 1 cell. The goal is to
            consume
            all the apples until the snake fills the entire grid, without having the snake hit the walls or
            itself.<br>There
            are trivial solutions that always ensure the snake finishes the game, such as a single Hamiltonian cycle,
            but
            our approach modifies this to be much more efficient by having the snake take fewer turns to finish the
            game.
            Each turn is specified as motion of the snake's "head" between 2 adjacent cells. One potential application
            of
            this algorithm is snake-like robots, which are often used in confined spaces or hazardous environments,
            where
            traditional wheeled or legged robots cannot operate. The snake game can be used to develop algorithms for
            planning the directed movement of these robots in a way that avoids obstacles and self-collision while
            completing tasks at random spots, the "apples", and then reporting the results back to the origin of the
            cycle.
            Another potential application is that the snake could represent the spread of a wildfire, and the food that
            the
            snake eats could represent the fuel that the fire needs to grow. The snake's growth could then be used to
            predict how the fire will spread and how to prevent it from reaching critical areas.

    <h3>
        3.1 &emsp; AI Approaches
    </h3>
    <h4>
        3.1.1 &emsp; Machine Learning Based Approaches
    </h4>
    <p>
        Machine learning approaches, such as Deep Q-Learning, have been used to teach an AI to learn the snake game.
        Other machine learning approaches have also been used, like Reinforcement Learning and Markov Decision
        Processing, but the Deep Q-learning approach has been most successful due to the large number of states in snake
        game <i><a href="#ref1">(Sebastianelli, Tipaldi, Ullo & Glielmo, 2021)</a></i>. However, this approach has been
        rather unsuccessful in completing a perfect game in which the snake fills the grid. In 30 tests using this
        method, the highest
        reached score (number of apples collected) on a 20x20 grid was 62 <i><a href="#ref1">(Sebastianelli, Tipaldi,
                Ullo & Glielmo, 2021)</a></i>, which is much lower than the 400 needed to reach a perfect game.
    </p>
    <h4>
        3.1.2 &emsp; Evolutionary Algorithm
    </h4>
    <p>
        An evolutionary algorithm is another approach that has been applied to the snake game problem. These algorithms
        use game scores from various functions “based on smoothness, space, and food” to find the function leading to
        the highest score <i><a href="#ref2">(Yeh, Su, Huang & Chiang, 2016)</a></i>. The functions are weighed based on
        various performance parameters, and then combined using crossover operators to add random mutations to them
        <i><a href="#ref2">(Yeh, Su, Huang & Chiang, 2016)</a></i>. The algorithm keeps running with new functions, and
        then combining the best functions in
        an evolutionary matter, to improve the algorithm. This approach has been moderately successful, but is very
        computationally demanding compared to the Hamiltonian approaches discussed below.
    </p>
    <h3>
        3.2 &emsp; Hamiltonian Cycle : The Trivial Case
    </h3>
    <p>
        A Hamiltonian cycle is defined as a path that traverses every vertex, or cell, exactly once, while returning to
        its original location <i><a href="#ref3">(Keller & Trotter, 2017)</a></i>. The base Hamiltonian approach follows
        one Hamiltonian cycle indiscriminately, ensuring the snake will always reach a perfect game, as it will never
        hit itself or the
        walls.

        <figcaption>Figure 1: The snake completing the Hamiltonian cycle</figcaption>
    </figure>
    As you can see in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> above, the snake (with its head in blue) will always follow that
    exact path no matter the
    location of the apple (in red). This approach is reliable, ensuring the snake always completes the game, but it can
    be made much more efficient, which is discussed in the section below.
    </p>
    <h3>3.3 &emsp; The Modified Cycle</h3>
    <p>
        Consider the scenario shown in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>. Following the Hamiltonian Path, the snake will
        proceed right, reaching
        the apple in 7 turns. However, if the snake instead moves down it will reach the apple in 1 turn, saving 6
        turns.

        <figcaption>Figure 2: Possible modifications of the cycle in the Snake Game</figcaption>
    </figure>
    However, taking shortcuts like the one explained above can sometimes lead to the entrapment and subsequent death
    of the snake.
    <figure id="fig3">
        <img class="notSnek" src="Snek AI_files/GridPositioning.png" alt="Grid Positioning">
        <figcaption>Figure 3: Numbering of cells on the board, ordered by position in the Hamiltonian cycle</figcaption>
    </figure>
    To enable the snake to take shortcuts, we changed the movement rules to the following:
    <ol>
        <li>The head may only move further along in the Hamiltonian cycle.</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>The head is allowed to skip sections of the cycle. For example, the head can move
                from position 3 to position 12 in the cycle. (Refer to <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a> for position labels
                on the snake grid)</li>
        </ol>
        <li>The head is not allowed to move to a position where the tail is between the head and
            the food if the head were to follow the Hamiltonian cycle.</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>For example, if the apple were at position 34 and the part of the tail at position
                25, the head would not be allowed to skip from 16 to 27, even though it would be
                normally allowed. This is to stop the snake from colliding with itself and ensures
                the snake can always revert to a Hamiltonian cycle if necessary.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>If the apple is further along in the cycle than the head, the head is only allowed to
            skip sections if it would get to the apple faster</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>For example, if the apple was at position 17 and the head at position 13, the head
                would be allowed to skip to position 16, but not 27.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>If the head is further along in the cycle than the apple, the head is only allowed to
            skip sections iff it would reach the end of the cycle faster</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>This is to reduce the amount of turns between apple consumptions.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>If the snake cannot skip ahead, move according to the Hamiltonian cycle.</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li><a href="#modified">Modified Hamiltonian + End Base Hamiltonian</a></li>
        </ol>
    </ol>

        3.4 &emsp; Modified Cycle with Endgame Hamiltonian
    </h3>
    <p>
        Although the previous algorithm improved the time between apple consumption when the snake was still relatively
        short, it would waste time later in the game, as shown in <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>.
    <figure id="fig5">
        <img class="notSnek" src="Snek AI_files/FancySnake.png" alt="Fancy Snake">
        <figcaption>Figure 5: Suboptimal performance in the snake game due to unlucky position of the apple</figcaption>
    </figure>
    Here, the snake has already consumed multiple apples on a modified cycle, but since the new apple has been placed
    behind the head, the snake has to complete another cycle in order to reach the apple again. In the worst case, the
    snake would have to complete one full cycle for a single apple consumed. However, this is not the case for a snake
    following a Hamiltonian path as shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>.<br>
    Since the apple may only be placed in non-snake squares, the apple is guaranteed to be reached in 64-n turns for a
    snake of length n in a Hamiltonian cycle, rather than the worst-case 64 turns of the modified cycle. While the
    modified cycle is usually faster when there is ample empty space, it often fails when the snake takes up the
    majority of the board. So when considering the worst-case scenario when the snake has already filled 32 cells (half
    of the board), the Hamiltonian cycle will fill the board in around <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'

    To take advantage of the behavior of the Hamiltonian cycle on mostly-filled boards, we add the condition to always

        <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a> above shows the distribution of game lengths (in turns to finish the game) of one
        million iterations each for the trivial Hamiltonian approach, the modified approach, and the combination of the
        modified approach and Hamiltonian approach. As shown in <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>, the average number of
        turns needed to complete a game is somewhat reduced by only modifying the cycle, but it was significantly
        reduced using the combination approach.
    </p>
    <h2>5 &emsp; Closing</h2>
    <p>
        In this report we showed how a Hamiltonian cycle can be applied to the snake game to ensure a perfect game is
        always reached. Building on this approach, we reduced the number of average turns by modifying the base cycle to
        better target the apple. Finally, we combinedapproaches to gain a total 36% speedup compared to the Hamiltonian
        cycle. In the future we will explore the possibility of incorporating traditional path-finding algorithms in our
        approach, such as Dijikstra's and A*.
